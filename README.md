# germanizator

A terrible library to transform english into phonetic german.

This uses an API wrapper to [lingorado](http://lingorado.com/ipa) to get the IPA from english.
Making this self-contained is a WIP.

## Sample Output

```
What is the meaning of life?
```

becomes

```
wat is de miehning awe lahiv?
```

### Disclaimer

No actually correctly speaking german person has been participating in this project.

Some actually correctly speaking german persons might have been hurt by this project. We apologies for that.

You should not use this library for anythin serious.
